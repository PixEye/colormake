colormake
---------

A script to colorize the output of make, ripping-off colormake.pl by Bjarni R. Einarsson,
with some changes and improvements.

The "mxmlc" branch is to be used with the mxml compiler instead of gcc (when you compile flex or flash for instance).


To install:
    ./setup.py install

Or, just copy 'colormake' and 'colormake.py' to somewhere in the path.

Then, you may want to edit your bashrc, adding something like,
    alias make='colormake'


To run tests:
    ./setup.py test
